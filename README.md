### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I''m Moses Liao

I am a backend server developer, DevOps and SRE Engineer, and a cloud architect

Services have to be secure and reliable, hence you find my interest in a cloud architect and site reliability engineering. I ensure SLA by doing load testing and deploying monitoring tools on apps to make sure anything that can bring the servers down will be pick up by me or someone similar to me first.
